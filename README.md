## :bulb: Motivation and Context

1. `animateDpAsState` and all that is super powerful tool for animation!!
1. `AnimatedVisibility` is another I love. probably my best pick among all tools.
1. Spent too much time on polishing the animation bit, still lots things to accomplish. 
1. First time using `ViewModel` ðŸ‘‹
